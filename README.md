## Sentiment Analysis with Python (LSTM-based Text Classification)

This repository provides a Python implementation of sentiment analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text classification. It allows you to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in various textual data sources like reviews, tweets, or social media comments.

**Project Overview:**

* **Goal:** Build a machine learning model to classify text into its underlying sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
* **Method:** The project employs LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically designed to handle sequential data like text.
* **Dataset:** Leverages a dataset containing over 14,000 tweets categorized as positive, negative, or neutral (download link provided).

**Key Features:**

* Comprehensive text preprocessing techniques: Data cleaning, normalization, tokenization, and vectorization.
* LSTM network architecture: Captures long-term dependencies within text sequences for improved sentiment classification.
* Visualizations: Provides insights into the model's performance using Matplotlib visualizations. (Consider adding sample visualizations)

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas (v1.2.4 or later)
* Matplotlib (v3.3.4 or later)
* TensorFlow (v2.4.1 or later)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.
3. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib tensorflow
